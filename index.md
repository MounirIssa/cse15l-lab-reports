# How to log into a course-specific account?
I will summarize it into __ steps below:
1. Access to the account. Before doing anything, you need to have an account for remote access. Go to https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php. Once on the page, type
in your UCSD username and PID to search for your lab account. Under the heading, additional accounts, you should be able to see a button that starts with the following
characters, cs15lwi23. The last part wi23 may change depending on your quarter, click that button and proceed.
2. If it is your first time logging in, you should see a request that asks you to reset your password. Go ahead and reset your password, remember it, and wait for
10 to 15 minutes. 
3. Open VSCode, if you do not have it installed, go to https://code.visualstudio.com/ and download it. Setting things up should be pretty simple, not much to do.
4. Next, go to VSCode, open a new terminal on VSCode and type the following:
$ ssh cs15lwi23ABC@ieng6.ucsd.edu
Replace ABC with your own account's letters.
5. You will receive a confirmation request asking you whether you really want to continue, type yes and continue.
6. Upon success, you will see this on your screen:
